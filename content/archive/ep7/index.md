title = "8 - Giving Great Constructive Criticism"
description = "Today I talk about giving great constructive criticism. While many of use are seeking self-improvement, a reality we must face is that we are not able to recognize our own flaws. This means that we are reliant on others to assess where we fall short. The critiques we give others is imperative in the improvement of their lives, and we have a responsibility to deliver the greatest value we can possible."
